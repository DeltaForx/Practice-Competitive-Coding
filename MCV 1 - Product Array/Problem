You are given a task to find the sum of Products of corresponding elements of two arrays of the same size.

The product sum is Summation (A[i]*B[i]) for all i from 1 to n where n is the size of both arrays

Input Format

First line of the input contains n and k delimited by whitespace
Second line contains the Array A (modifiable array) with its values delimited by spaces
Third line contains the Array B (non-modifiable array) with its values delimited by spaces
Constraints

1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ |A[i]|, |B[i]| ≤ 10^5
0 ≤ K ≤ 10^9
Output Format

Output the minimum sum of products of the two arrays.
